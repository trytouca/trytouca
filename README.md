# Touca

Touca helps you understand the side-effects of your day to day code changes on
the behavior and performance of your overall software.

Touca SDKs let you describe the behavior and performance of your code by
capturing values of interesting variables and runtime of important functions. We
remotely compare your description against a trusted version of your software,
visualize all differences, and report them in near real-time.
