# Submitting Results

## Capturing Files

:::note New

Added in v1.8.0

<details>
<summary>touca check --help</summary>

```plaintext
usage: touca check --suite SUITE [--testcase TESTCASE] src

Submit external test output to Touca server

positional arguments:
  src                  path to file or directory to submit

options:
  --suite SUITE        name of the suite to associate with this output
  --testcase TESTCASE  name of the testcase to associate with this output
```

</details>

You can use `touca check` to submit any external file(s) that may have been
generated as part of the test run.

```plaintext
$ touca config set api-key=a66fe9d2-00b7-4f7c-95d9-e1b950d0c906
$ touca config set team=tutorial-509512
$ touca check ./output.file --suite=my-suite
```

Since we did not specify the testcase, `touca check` will infer it from
`./output.file` as `output-file`.

You can also submit an entire directory, in which case, every file would be
treated as a separate testcase. You can pass `--testcase` to submit them all as
part of one testcase.

```plaintext
$ touca check ./output/ --suite=my-suite
```

Another use-case of `touca check` is submitting the standard output of any given
process to treat as a test result.

```plaintext
$ echo "hello" | touca check --suite=my-suite --testcase=my-testcase
```

Note that in the above case, setting `--testcase` was mandatory since there is
no filename to infer it from.

## Running Tests Locally

                        Save a copy of test results on local filesystem in binary format
  --save-as-json [SAVE_JSON]
                        Save a copy of test results on local filesystem in JSON format

  --testcase TESTCASES [TESTCASES ...], --testcases TESTCASES [TESTCASES ...]
                        One or more testcases to feed to the workflow
  --filter WORKFLOW_FILTER
                        Name of the workflow to run
  --log-level {debug,info,warn}
                        Level of detail with which events are logged
  --colored-output [COLORED_OUTPUT]

  --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        Path to a configuration file
```

</details>

Touca CLI makes it convenient to locally execute Touca tests written using the
Touca Python SDK. Simply navigate to any directory and run `touca test` with
your preferred options to execute all the Touca workflows in that directory.

```plaintext
$ git clone git@github.com:trytouca/trytouca.git
$ cd trytouca/examples/python/02_python_main_api/
$ touca config set api-key=a66fe9d2-00b7-4f7c-95d9-e1b950d0c906
$ touca config set team=tutorial-509512
$ touca test
```

## Running Tests on a Test Machine

<details>
<summary>touca run --help</summary>

```plaintext
usage: touca run -p PROFILE [-r REVISION]

Run tests on a dedicated test server

options:
  -p PROFILE, --profile PROFILE
                        path to the profile file
  -r REVISION, --revision REVISION
                        specific version to run
```

</details>

`touca test` is convenient for running Touca tests on your own machine or as
part of the CI workflow. But these two environments have important limitations:

- Running Touca tests at scale with a large set of test cases could be time
  consuming, leading to longer build times.
- Our test workflows may require access to input data that could be large in
  size and difficult to provision on a build server.
- Performance benchmarks obtained on a build server are prone to noise.

To allow testing mission-critical software workflows at scale, Touca CLI
provides the `touca run` command that is designed to be used on a dedicated test
machine. This command takes a recipe describing your software delivery pipeline
specification to download and deploy new releases of your software and to run
your tests against it.

Let us imagine that we want to automatically run Touca tests that are packaged
as a `.msi` installer and deployed to Artifactory as part of our build pipeline.
Our objective is to setup a testing pipeline that periodically checks
Artifactory for newer versions of this installer, pulls new versions, install
them, executes the Touca tests, and manages their generated test results.

```bash
touca run --profile ./sample.json
```

Where `sample.json` is a test profile that describes our test setup:

```json title="sample.json"
{
  "execution": {
    "archive-dir": "C:\\Acme\\Results",
    "executable": "Sample_Touca_Test.exe",
    "config": "sample.config.json",
    "suite": "sample"
  },
  "artifactory": {
    "base-url": "http://artifactory.acme.com",
    "installer-msi-url": "{repo}/{group}/{name}/{version}.zip!/{name}.msi",
    "installer-msi-location": "C:\\Program Files\\Acme\\Sample",
    "repo": "bin-integration-local",
    "group": "com.acme",
    "name": "Sample"
  }
}
```

Check out our
[JSON schema](https://github.com/trytouca/trytouca/blob/main/sdk/python/touca/cli/config/profile.schema.json)
file for a full list of supported fields and scenarios.

We can use Windows Task Scheduler or Linux Cron Jobs to automate the execution
of the above command. If we intend to run Touca test for every version of our
code, we can use a short polling interval such as 5 minutes. The CLI gracefully
exits if there are no new versions of our software available in Artifactory.

For Touca enterprise customers, we provide the test infrastructure and tooling
required to remotely execute Touca tests at scale and based on custom
requirements.
