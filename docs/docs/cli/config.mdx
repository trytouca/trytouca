# Configuring

## Configuration Options

<details>
<summary>touca config --help</summary>

```plaintext
usage: touca config [-h] {home,show,set,get,rm} ...

Manage your active configuration profile

    home                Print path to active configuration file
    show                Print content of active configuration file
    set                 Set a value for a configuration option
    get                 Get value of a configuration option
    rm                  Remove a configuration option
```

</details>

Many Touca commands take one or more configuration options. Passing these
options every time you use `touca` would not be great. Specifically,
configuration options like API Key and API URl barely change from one run to the
next. For better user experience, you can use `touca config` to set these
options in a configuration file that is automatically read by other subcommands.

```plaintext
$ touca config set api-key=a66fe9d2-00b7-4f7c-95d9-e1b950d0c906
$ touca config set api-url=https://api.touca.io/@/tutorial-509512
```

You can use `touca config home` to see where these configuration options are
kept.

```plaintext
$ touca config home
~/.touca
```

You can use `touca config show` to view the content of your activate
configuration file:

```plaintext
$ touca config show

      Option    Value
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1   api-key   a66fe9d2-00b7-4f7c-95d9-e1b950d0c906
  2   api-url   https://api.touca.io/@/tutorial-509512

```

You can also check the value of any given option:

```plaintext
$ touca config get
https://api.touca.io/@/tutorial-509512
```

Touca uses `https://api.touca.io` for `api-url` if it is not specified so we can
use `touca config rm` to remove this option from the configuration file:

```plaintext
$ touca config rm api-url
$ touca config set team=tutorial-509512
```

## Configuration Profiles

<details>
<summary>touca profile --help</summary>

```plaintext
usage: touca profile [-h] {ls,set,rm,cp} ...

Create and manage configuration profiles

    ls            List available profiles
    set           Change active profile
    rm            Delete profile with specified name
    cp            Copy content of a profile to a new or existing profile
```

</details>

By default, `touca config set` stores your configuration options into
`~/.touca/profiles/default`. This is enough for most use cases but if you use
the same machine for submitting test results for work and for personal projects,
you may want to have separate configuration profiles with different values for
`api-url` and other parameters. `touca profile` lets you create different
profiles and switch between them.

You can use `touca profile set` to create a new profile or switch to an existing
profile:

```plaintext
$ touca profile set personal
```

You can use `touca profile cp` to create a new profile with all the
configuration options of your active profile:

```plaintext
$ touca profile cp personal work
```

You can use `touca profile ls` to list your profiles:

```plaintext
$ touca profile ls

      Name
 ──────────────────────────
  1   default
  2   development (active)
  3   staging

```

And if you no longer need a profile, you can use `touca profile rm` to remove
it:

```plaintext
$ touca profile rm personal
```

## Login

<details>
<summary>touca login --help</summary>

```plaintext
usage: touca login [-h] [--api-url API_URL]

Log into your Touca server from the CLI

options:
  --api-url API_URL  Touca API URL
```

</details>

If you do not have an API key set yet, you may use `touca login` to log into
your Touca account from the command line. It will direct you to a browser window
where you can log into your account and have your API key automatically set for
the current configuration profile.

By default, `https://api.touca.io` is used as `api-url` if the configuration
option is not set. You may also provide a URL to a self-hosted instance using
the `--api-url` option.
