You can use `touca server install` to set up a local instance of Touca server
using `docker-compose`. This subcommand interactively asks for the server
installation path. You can set this path using `--install-dir` option to disable
runtime interaction. We recommend installing Touca into `~/.touca/server`.

You can use `touca server status` to check the status of your local Touca server
instance. By default, this subcommand assumes that the server is running on
port 8080. You can use `--port` to change this behavior.

You can use `touca server logs` to show the last 1000 logs of the main Touca
container.

You can use `touca server upgrade` to upgrade a your local Touca server to the
latest version. Similarly, you can use `touca server uninstall` to uninstall it.
Both subcommands may prompt you for the server installation path if it is
different than `~/.touca/server`.
