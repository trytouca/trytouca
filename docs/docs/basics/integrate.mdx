# Manage Notifications

You can subscribe to a given suite to get notified of important events about it.
These events include:

- When a team member promotes a new version to baseline.
- When a team member adds a note to a given version.
- When a new version is submitted that is different from the baseline.

You can also configure your subscription to include notifications about new
versions that match the behavior and performance of baseline version.

When a new version has differences compared to the baseline, the notification
will include a summary of those differences. You can always click on "View
Results" to inspect the differences on the Touca server.

When someone on your team promotes a new version to baseline, the notification
will include any note they may have written as justification.

Lastly, if you choose to receive notifications about all new versions, you may
rely on emails from Touca as confirmation that a new version matches the
baseline.
