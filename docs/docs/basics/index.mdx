# Concepts

Let's imagine we are building a software to check whether workers at a
construction site are wearing hard hats. Our software takes an image as input
and uses an object detection algorithm to identify people and helmets within the
image.

  }}

Our software could be complex. We could break it down to smaller components and
write unit tests for each component. We could also write integration tests that
feed a few images to our workflow code under test and check the coordinates of
identified objects within an image. We would need a large number of test inputs
to gain confidence that our software is production-ready and can handle
real-world inputs. This may be a problem:

- Describing the expected behavior of our software for each test input is
  difficult.
- Future improvements to our software may require adjusting the expected values
  which is cumbersome.

Touca aims to solve these problems by taking a different approach. Instead of
asserting the output of each test against hard-coded expected values, Touca
captures the actual behavior and performance of our software for each test case
and compares them against a previous trusted version.

This is a great time to sign up [on Touca](https://app.touca.io). You will need
your API Key and URL to complete this hands-on tutorial. See
[here](/server/account-setup) for instructions.

In this tutorial, we will use the Touca CLI to see how Touca works in action. In
the next tutorial, we will learn how to use Touca SDKs to write tests and
capture data programmatically.

<InstallCommands />

Touca CLI has [various commands](/cli) for different operations. Let's use the
`config` command to set our API Key and API URL.

```bash
touca config set api-key="<your-api-key>"
touca config set api-url="<your-api-url>"
```

Touca CLI is also extensible to help us add plugins that save us from writing
code for common use-cases. Let's install a "demo" plugin and run it to download
sample data for version `v1.0` of our `hard helmets` example and make them
available in the `tutorial` directory of our current working directory.

```bash
touca plugin add plugins://demo
touca demo download v1.0
```

To test `v1.0`, we have run our code under test with 10 different images and
have captured the output of our software, including a JSON file that lists the
detected objects in each image and a JPG file visualizing those detected
objects.

Since this is the first working version of our software, we can spend some time
inspecting the results and verifying their correctness. If we were using unit
testing, we would start writing assertions against the JSON output. With Touca,
we can capture the output test results and establish them as baseline.

```bash
touca check --suite=helmets tutorial/v1.0
```

<ThemedImage

    dark: "https://touca.io/docs/external/assets/touca-cli-check-tutorial-v1.dark.gif"
  }}
/>

Unlike snapshot testing, Touca stores the captured test results on a remote
server. The server automatically compares the results for newly submitted
versions against our baseline version and reports the differences in near
real-time. This approach removes the need for storing snapshot files in version
control and enables comparing any two versions of your software and visualizing
their differences. And since building software is often a team effort, Touca
gives your team controlled access to the state of your software workflows and
how they evolve over time.

In our `hard helmets` example, now that we established a baseline, we can re-run
`touca check` every time we make changes to our software to compare subsequent
versions against the baseline.

```bash
touca demo download v1.1
touca check --suite=helmets tutorial/v1.1
```

Let's navigate to the Touca server to see how `v1.1` of our `hard helmets`
example behaves compared to `v1.0` and decide whether those differences are
improvements or unintended regressions.

    dark: "https://touca.io/docs/external/assets/touca-concepts-element.dark.jpg"
  }}
/>

For the above test case, it looks like `v1.1` performs object detections more
accurately. We can inspect the differences in other test cases to decide if
`v1.1` is indeed working better. If we choose to ship `v1.1`, we can promote
this version as the new baseline so that subsequent versions are compared
against it.

`touca check` is a convenient way to track changes in the output of our software
without the need to write code. It works similar to `diff` except you don't need
to have the two sides of comparison available at the same time. But
`touca check` is limited to capturing the output of a process such as generated
files and standard streams. Many complex system components that need regression
testing rarely produce any external output. Touca provides SDKs for different
programming languages that allow capturing values of variables and runtime of
functions from our code.
