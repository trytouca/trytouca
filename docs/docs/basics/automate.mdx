# Running Tests

## Leveraging Continuous Integration

We can choose to run Touca Tests as part of our CI pipeline. Regardless of what
CI solution we use, we can add a step to our build pipeline that invokes Touca
tests with the appropriate API Key and API URL.

### Using Github Actions

If you are using **GitHub Actions**, create a new repository secret called
`TOUCA_API_KEY` in the "Settings" tab of your GitHub repository.

<ThemedImage
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl("img/assets/touca-automate-secret.png"),
    dark: useBaseUrl("img/assets/touca-automate-secret.png")
  }}
/>

Now running the test is as simple as invoking the test and passing credentials
as environment variables:

```yaml
- run: ./local/dist/bin/example_cpp_main_api
  env:
    TOUCA_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TOUCA_API_KEY }}
    TOUCA_API_URL: https://api.touca.io/@/<your-team>
```

You can also use the Touca CLI to run your tests:

```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
- run: pip install touca
- run: touca test
  working-directory: 02_python_main_api
  env:
    TOUCA_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.TOUCA_API_KEY }}
    TOUCA_API_URL: https://api.touca.io/@/examples
```

Alternatively, you can use our GitHub Actions plugins for obtaining Touca CLI
and using it to run your tests:

```yaml
- uses: trytouca/actions-setup-touca@v1
  with:
    api_key: ${{ secrets.TOUCA_API_KEY }}
    api_url: https://api.touca.io/@/<your-team>
- uses: trytouca/actions-run-tests@v1
  with:
    directory: ./examples/python/02_python_main_api
```

Now every time you push changes to the `main` branch of your repository, your
tests will automatically run and submit results to the Touca server.

For a working prototype, check out our own
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/trytouca/trytouca/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml#L689-L698)
which includes running sample Touca tests for different programming languages.

## Using a Dedicated Test Server

Running Touca tests as part of the CI is convenient but it has important
limitations:

- Running Touca tests at scale with a large set of test cases could be time
  consuming, leading to longer build times.
- Our test workflows may require access to input data that could be large in
  size and difficult to provision on a build server.
- Performance benchmarks obtained on a build server are prone to noise.

We can mitigate these limitations using a dedicated test server that can store
our input test data and run our tests continuously or on a fixed schedule.

If you prefer running tests on your own infrastructure, you can use the Touca
CLI command `touca run` that takes a recipe describing your software delivery
pipeline specification to download and deploy new releases of your sosftware and
to run your tests against it. Refer to the
[documentation](/cli/test/#running-tests-on-a-test-machine) for this CLI command
for more info.

For Touca enterprise customers, we provide the test infrastructure and tooling
required to remotely execute Touca tests at scale and based on custom
requirements.
