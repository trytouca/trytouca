# Good First Issues

Are you thinking about contributing to Touca but don't really know where to
start? This page lists a few good first projects that are relatively small in
scope, have clear requirements, and don't need a deep understanding of how Touca
works. We hope that you find at least one of them interesting enough to start
contributing to Touca. If that's not the case, come say hi on
[Discord](https://touca.io/discord) and ask us for a few more suggestions.
