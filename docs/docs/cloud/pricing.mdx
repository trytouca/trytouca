# Free plan

Touca has a free and open-source edition, ideal for individuals and very small
businesses. Software engineers can freely sign-up (no credit card required) on
our managed cloud instance at [app.touca.io](https://app.touca.io) and go
through our self-serve onboarding to get started with Touca and learn more about
it. Alternatively, they could self-host their own Touca server OSS edition using
our `docker-compose` file. We also offer a Helm Chart to help them deploy Touca
to a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

<summary>ðŸ’¡ How is Touca Cloud different from self-hosted instances?</summary>

- Touca Cloud is fully managed. We maintain and upgrade this instance to provide
  the most convenience for customers and the best experience for users.
- Touca Cloud has a different architecture to provide highest availability, and
  maximum scalability. We use AWS services like S3, DocumentDB, and Elasticache
  to provide reliable infrastructure for handling the most demanding use-cases.
  In contrast, self-hosted instances of Touca server use off-the-shelf Minio,
  MongoDB, and Redis docker containers that are less scalable and require
  periodic maintenance to manage disk space, etc.
- Touca Cloud has exclusive features like PDF report generation, Single Sign-On
  with Google, that are only available on our paid plans.
