# Getting Started

## What is Touca

Touca gives fast feedback about the unintended side-effects of your day to day
code changes. It continuously checks if your software works as well as before to
increase your confidence and improve your productivity. We remotely compare the
behavior and performance of your software workflows for a variety of inputs
against a previous trusted version and report differences in near real-time to
help you fix regressions before they become costly.
