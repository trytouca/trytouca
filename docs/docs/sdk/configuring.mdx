# Configuring

Touca SDKs and CLI are designed to be configurable while providing common-sense
conventions that make most configuration parameters optional. Some of these
parameters, like API Key, are needed for completion of certain operations, like
submitting results to the Touca server. Other parameters help you customize the
SDK behavior and/or its test runner based on your preferences.

In this document, we will learn the various methods for configuring the Touca
test runner, certain CLI commands like `touca check` and `touca test`, and the
Touca core library. These methods include passing options from the command-line,
using a JSON configuration file, loading options from your configuration
profile, setting options with environment variables, and remote fetching of test
cases and version number from the Touca server.

## Passing options from the command-line

Touca CLI command `touca test` as well as the built-in Touca test runner support
various command-line options that let you set most configuration parameters when
running the test.

```bash
cd trytouca/examples/python/02_python_main_api
touca test --offline --revision=1.0 --team=acme
```

The command above runs Touca test workflows declared in the current working in
"offline" mode (disabling all communications with the Touca server) and
associates the test results with version `1.0` and team `acme`. See
[`touca test`](../../cli/test/#running-tests-locally) for the full list of
supported command-line options.

We generally recommend only using command-line options for one-off modifications
to the behavior of the test runner in local environments. For example, when you
are writing a Touca test and you want to see the data points you are capturing
for a particular test case, it may be convenient to store the test results in
JSON and skip their submission to the Touca server:

```bash
cd trytouca/examples/python/02_python_main_api
touca test --offline --testcase=alice --save-as-json --overwrite --revision=1.0 --team=acme
```

<summary>Using `--config-file`</summary>

You could also specify configuration options in your own JSON file and pass the
file via the command-line option `--config-file`. The test runner attempts to
parse the file and load any configuration parameter specified in a top-level
`touca` field.

```bash
cd trytouca/examples/js/02_node_main_api
npm install && npm run build
node dist/students_test.js --config-file package.json
```

```json title="package.json"
{
  ...
  "touca": {
    "revision": "1.0",
    "offline": true,
    "overwrite": true,
    "save_binary": true,
    "team": "acme",
    "testcases": [
      "alice"
    ]
  }
  ...
}
```

</details>

## Loading options from a configuration profile

In typical use-cases, the values of most configuration options are the same
between test runs. Using command-line arguments to set these options may not be
very convenient. It would be easier to set them in a configuration profile to be
looked up and applied automatically as you run your tests.

You can use the CLI command [`touca config`](../cli#configuration-options) to
set these options in your active configuration profile:

```bash
touca config set api-key=8c3b03a8-0836-4066-b663-f7a44f19fb32
touca config set http://localhost:8080/api/@/acme
touca config set save_binary=true
touca test
```

You can have multiple configuration profiles for different environments. You can
manage your configuration profiles via the CLI command
[`touca profile`](../cli#configuration-profiles).

## Setting options with environment variables

Configuration profiles are often the best way to store options persistently
across the test runs. However, when running tests in the CI environment, you may
not want to pass certain options, such as the API Key which is sensitive
information, in plain-text. A better alternative is using environment variables.
Touca SDKs (and the CLI) support the following environment variables:

| Variable             | Purpose                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `TOUCA_API_KEY`      | Touca API Key                  |
| `TOUCA_API_URL`      | Touca API URL                  |
| `TOUCA_TEST_VERSION` | Version of the code under test |

## Fetching options from the remote server

You can set most options in a configuration profile because they rarely change
from one version to another, except the version itself. In CI pipelines, it may
make sense to set the version as an environment variable that corresponds to
your build version. But there are two problems:

- If you are running tests locally, passing the version as a command-line
  argument and incrementing it every time may be inconvenient.
- If you are running multiple workflows at the same time, you may want to use
  different versions for each workflow.

To address these limitations, when you do not specify the version, unless they
are configured to run in offline mode, Touca SDKs will query the server for the
latest submitted version for each workflow and use the minor increment to those
versions.

You can also rely on the SDKs to retrieve the list of test cases for your test
workflows. When testcases are not specified via other mechanisms, unless they
are configured to run in offline mode, the SDKs will find and reuse the list of
test cases submitted to the baseline version of each workflow.

## Configuring the core library

With the exception of environment variables, the methods described above are
only relevant to the built-in test runner and CLI commands like `touca test` and
`touca check`. Advanced users who may be using the core library API to write
their own test framework or integrate Touca with other test frameworks should
use the low-level `configure` function to pass relevant configuration options,
as described in the [Core API](../core-api#configuring-the-client) documentation
page.
