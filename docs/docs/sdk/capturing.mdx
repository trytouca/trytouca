# Capturing Test Results

In the previous tutorial, we reviewed the main Touca functions for describing
the behavior and performance of our code under test, by capturing values of
important variables and runtime of interesting functions. In this section, we
dive a little deeper to explain how Touca tracks values of variables and
performance benchmarks.

## Preserving Data Types

Touca data capturing functions such as `check`, preserve the types of all
captured data so that the Touca server can compare them in their original type.

  values={[
    { label: "Python", value: "python" },
    { label: "C++", value: "cpp" },
    { label: "JavaScript", value: "js" },

```py
touca.check("username", student.username)
touca.check("fullname", student.fullname)
touca.check("birth_date", student.dob)
touca.check("gpa", student.gpa)
```

In the example above, `touca.check` stores value of properties `username` and
`fullname` as string while properties `dob` and `gpa` are stored as
`datetime.date` and `float` respectively. The server visualizes possible
differences in these values based on their types.

The SDK is designed to handle iterables and custom objects by serializing their
elements and properties. This makes it possible for us to add object `student`
as a single entity, if we so choose.

  <TabItem value="cpp">

```cpp
touca::check("username", student.username);
touca::check("fullname", student.fullname);
touca::check("gpa", student.gpa);
```

In the example above, `touca::check` stores value of properties `username` and
`fullname` as `std::string` while property `gpa` is stored as `float`. The
server visualizes possible differences in these values based on their types.

```ts
touca.check("username", student.username);
touca.check("fullname", student.fullname);
touca.check("birth_date", student.dob);
touca.check("gpa", student.gpa);
```

In the example above, `touca.check` stores value of properties `username` and
`fullname` as string while properties `dob` and `gpa` are stored as `Date` and
`number` respectively. The server visualizes possible differences in these
values based on their types.

Touca.check("birth_date", student.dob);

In the example above, `Touca.check` stores value of properties `username` and
`fullname` as `String` while properties `dob` and `gpa` are stored as
`java.time.LocalDate` and `double` respectively. The server visualizes possible
differences in these values based on their types.

## Customizing Data Serialization

While Touca data capturing functions automatically support objects and custom
types, it is possible to override the serialization logic for any given
non-primitive data type.

Consider the following definition for a custom class `Course`.

```py
@dataclass
class Course:
    name: str
    grade: float
```

By default, the SDK serializes objects of this class using by serializing all of
its public properties. This behavior results in object `Course("math", 3.9)` to
be serialized as `{name: "math", grade: 3.9}`. We can use `touca.add_serializer`
to override this default behavior. The following code results in the same object
to be serialized as `["math", 3.9]`:

```py
touca.add_serializer(Course, lambda x: [x.name, x.grade])
for course in student.courses:
    touca.add_array_element("courses", course)
    touca.add_hit_count("number of courses")
```

While our serializer changed the way `Course` data is serialized and visualized,
it still preserved both properties of this object. If we like to exclude the
property `name` during serialization and limit the comparison to `grade`, we
could use `(x: Course) => x.grade` instead

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cpp">

Touca C++ SDK has built-in support for many commonly-used types of the standard
library and can be extended to support custom data types.

Consider the following definition for a user-defined type `Date`.

```cpp
struct Date {
  unsigned short year;
  unsigned short month;
  unsigned short day;
};
```

Using the natively supported types, we can add a value of type `Date` as three
separate test results that each cover individual member variables. But this
practice is cumbersome and impractical for real-world complex data types. To
solve this, we can extend Touca type system to support type `Date` using partial
template specialization.

```cpp
#include "touca/touca.hpp"

template <>
struct touca::serializer<Date> {
  data_point serialize(const Date& value) {
    return object("Date")
        .add("year", value.year)
        .add("month", value.month)
        .add("day", value.day);
  }
};
```

Once the client library learns how to handle a custom type, it automatically
supports handling it as sub-component of other types. As an example, with the
above-mentioned partial template specialization for type `Date`, we can start
adding test results of type `std::vector<Date>` or `std::map<string, Date>`.
Additionally, supporting type `Date` enables objects of this type to be used as
smaller components of even more complex types.

```cpp
touca::check("birth_date", student.dob);
```

Consult with the Reference API documentation for more information and examples
for supporting custom types.

Touca SDKs have native support for primitive data types such as integers and
floating point numbers, characters and string, arrays and maps, and other
commonly used data types. You can extend and override the built-in serialization
logic for any given non-primitive data type.

Consider the following definition for a custom class `Course`.

```ts
export class Course {
  constructor(public readonly name: string, public readonly grade: number) {}
}
```

By default, the SDK serializes objects of this class using by serializing all of
its public properties. This behavior results in object `Course('math', 3.9)` to
be serialized as `{name: 'math', grade: '3.9}`. We can use
`touca.add_serializer` to override this default behavior. The following code
results in the same object to be serialized as `['math', 3.9]`:

```ts
touca.add_serializer(Course.name, (x: Course) => [x.name, x.grade]);
for (const course of student.courses) {
  touca.add_array_element("courses", course);
  touca.add_hit_count("number of courses");
}
```

While our serializer changed the way `Course` data is serialized and visualized,
it still preserved both properties of this object. If we like to exclude the
property `name` during serialization and limit the comparison to `grade`, we
could use `(x: Course) => x.grade` instead.

While Touca data capturing functions automatically support objects and custom

non-primitive data type.

Consider the following definition for a custom class `Course`.

```java
public final class Course {
  public String name;
  public double grade;

  public Course(final String name, final double grade) {
    this.name = name;
    this.grade = grade;
  }
}
```

By default, the SDK serializes objects of this class using by serializing all of
its public properties. This behavior results in object `Course("math", 3.9)` to
be serialized as `{name: "math", grade: 3.9}`. We can use `Touca.addTypeAdapter`
to override this default behavior. The following code excludes the property
`name` during serialization and limits the comparison to `grade`:

```java
Touca.addTypeAdapter(Course.class, course -> course.grade);
for (Course course: student.courses) {
  Touca.addArrayElement("courses", course);
  Touca.addHitCount("number of courses");
}
```

It is sufficient to register each serializer once per lifetime of the test
application.
