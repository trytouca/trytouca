## C++ SDK

### Using CMake

Assuming that your project is already using CMake, the easiest way to pull Touca
as a dependency is to use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) v3.11 or newer which
includes CMake's
[FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html)
module.

```text
FetchContent_Declare(
    touca
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/trytouca/trytouca
    GIT_TAG        v1.6.0
    SOURCE_SUBDIR  sdk/cpp
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(touca)
```

#### Building Extra Components

The above code pulls the latest stable release of the Touca SDK for C++ and
generates a `touca_client` CMake target that you can link to.

We can use the slightly more verbose `FetchContent_GetProperties` pattern to
customize the set of build targets, to include building Touca command-line
application and example projects or to exclude building the test runner:

```text
FetchContent_Declare(
    touca
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/trytouca/trytouca
    GIT_TAG        v1.6.0
    SOURCE_SUBDIR  sdk/cpp
)

FetchContent_GetProperties(touca)
if(NOT touca_POPULATED)
    FetchContent_Populate(touca)
    set(TOUCA_BUILD_CLI ON)
    set(TOUCA_BUILD_EXAMPLES ON)
    add_subdirectory(${touca_SOURCE_DIR})
endif()
```

#### Enabling HTTPS

The SDK has an optional dependency on OpenSSL for communicating with the Touca
server over HTTPS. In most platforms, this library is automatically discovered
and used by the build recipe. If OpenSSL is not installed in the default
location, we may need to provide its root directory as a hint to the libraryâ€™s
build recipe. Here is a typical way to do so on macOS when OpenSSL is installed
through `homebrew`.

```text
set(OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@1.1)
```

### Using Conan

As an alternative, you can use [Conan](https://conan.io/) to pull Touca as a
dependency. Conan is a cross-platform package manager that enables efficient
management of project dependencies. Refer to
[Conan documentation](https://docs.conan.io/) to learn more.

#### Setting Up Conan

If you do not have Conan locally installed, the preferred way to install it is
through the Python Package Index using the `pip` command:

```bash
pip install conan
```

If this is the first time you are using Conan, we recommend that you setup a
Conan profile based on your system environment.

```bash
conan profile new default --detect
conan profile update settings.compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11 default
```

#### Installing Touca

We can now install Touca using the Conan package manager. To do so, we first
register Touca's Conan remote repository.

```bash
conan remote add touca-cpp https://getweasel.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/conan/touca-cpp
```

We can now ask Conan to install Touca as a dependency and generate a CMake find
module that we can integrate with our build system.

```bash
conan install -if "${dir_build}" -g cmake_find_package -b missing "touca/1.6.0@_/_"
```

Where `${dir_build}` is the path to the CMake build directory.

#### Discovering Conan Packages

Assuming we use `${dir_build}` as our CMake binary directory, to discover and
use the Conan-generated CMake find module we can ensure `${dir_build}` is part
of our CMake module path.

```text
list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR})
find_package("touca" QUIET)
```

This lets us link the Touca sdk with our project like any other library.

```text
target_link_libraries(<YOUR_PROJECT> PRIVATE touca)
```

### Building from Source

#### Requirements

You can build Touca on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms. We support C++11 and
newer standards. We use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as our build system. You
would need CMake v3.14 or newer to build Touca. We formally support the
following compilers:

| Compiler     | Min Version |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| x86-64 gcc   | 7.1         |
| x86-64 clang | 7.0.0       |
| x64 MSVC     | 1900        |

#### Obtaining the Source Code

Touca SDK for C++ is available
[on GitHub](https://github.com/trytouca/trytouca/tree/main/sdk/cpp) under the
Apache-2.0 license. Clone this repository to a directory of your choice. We
refer to this directory as `<project_directory>`.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:trytouca/trytouca.git
cd sdk/cpp
```

#### Using Our Helper Script

Touca SDK for C++ has five main components.

| Name              | Build Argument    |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Core Library      |                   |
| Test Runner       | `--with-runner`   |
| Sample Test Tools | `--with-examples` |
| Command Line Tool | `--with-cli`      |
| Unit Tests        | `--with-tests`    |

We provide build scripts `build.sh` and `build.bat` for Unix and Windows
platforms, respectively. The build scripts build the core library and the test
runner by default. You can pass the appropriate argument shown in the table
above to build other components as needed.

As an example, the command below builds all the components except the unit
tests.

```bash
./build.sh --with-cli --with-examples
```

You can build all of the components using the `--all` argument.

```bash
./build.sh --all
```

#### Using CMake Directly

If, for any reason, you do not want to build Touca using our helper scripts, you
can always use CMake directly. To do so, we recommend running the following
command first, to configure the build targets and specify the path in which
build artifacts should be generated. While you can change the build directory to
the directory of your choice, the subsequent instructions assume the default
value of `./local/build`.

```bash
cmake -B"<project_directory>/local/build" -H"<project_directory>"
```

By default, the above-mentioned command configures CMake to build the core Touca
Client Library. But Touca has several other components that can be enabled by
passing the appropriate options to the command above, as listed in the table
below.

| Component Name    | CMake Option           | Default |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------- |
| Test Runner       | `TOUCA_BUILD_RUNNER`   | ON      |
| Command Line Tool | `TOUCA_BUILD_CLI`      | OFF     |
| Sample Test Tools | `TOUCA_BUILD_EXAMPLES` | OFF     |
| Unit Tests        | `TOUCA_BUILD_TESTS`    | OFF     |

As an example, the command below enables building sample Touca tests.

```bash
cmake -B"<project_directory>/local/build" -H"<project_directory>" -DTOUCA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
```

We can build the source code via CMake which uses the native build tool of your
platform.

```bash
cmake --build "<project_directory>/local/build" --parallel
```

Optionally, as a last step, we can install the build artifacts in a directory of
our choice for easier packaging.

```bash
cmake --install "<project_directory>/local/build" --prefix "<project_directory>/local/dist"
```
