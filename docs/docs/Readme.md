# About Touca

Welcome to Touca! üëãüèº

We help software engineers see the side effects of their changes as they write
code. Our open-source SDKs enable you to describe the behavior and performance
of your code by capturing values of interesting variables and runtime of
important functions from anywhere within your code. We remotely compare your
description against a trusted version of your software and visualize differences
in near real-time.

On average, it takes 23 days for software engineers to gain confidence that a
given code change works as they intended. Touca significantly shortens this
feedback cycle. It helps you continuously test important software workflows with
any number of real-world inputs. We seamlessly integrate with developer
workflows to provide near real-time feedback when you write code that could
break your software.

Check out our [Getting Started](basics/quickstart) guide to learn how Touca
works and how it can help you build better software faster.
