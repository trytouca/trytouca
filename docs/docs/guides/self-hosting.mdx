# Self-Hosting

You could deploy Touca on your own infrastructure. This page shows you how.

We've made the process straightforward and self-serve. But we are here to help
if you ever needed help or had any questions. You could
[join our Community Discord server](https://discord.gg/pTXKTVzPpA),
[send us an email](mailto:support@touca.io), or
[schedule a free 1:1 pairing session](https://calendly.com/ghorbanzade/30min).

:::info

Most of our paid plans include dedicated support and professional services for
deploying and upgrading self-hosted instances of Touca.

:::

## Prerequisites

Touca server has a few components and services. In the most common scenario, you
could deploy them as Docker containers on a single machine and make adjustments
based on your scalability and fault-tolerance requirements.

The instructions below help you get started with this common scenario. To run
this script, you need a UNIX machine with at least 2GB of RAM, with Docker and
Docker Compose, and AWS CLI installed. You need our deployment scripts that
include a Docker Compose file that pulls docker images from our private Elastic
Container Registry. You also need our AWS Credentials to authenticate to our
ECR.

There is no restriction for the choice of Unix distribution. However, the
instructions below are written for and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS distribution.

## Prepare your machine

This section helps you install Docker, Docker Compose, or AWS CLI if you do not
have them installed. They are provided for completeness.

  <TabItem value="setup">

If you have just provisioned a virtual machine, here are a few general best
practices to secure it for production use.

Create a new user

```bash
sudo adduser touca
sudo usermod -aG sudo touca
```

Add public key authentication

```bash
rsync --archive --chown=touca:touca ~/.ssh /home/touca
```

Disable password authentication

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Set `PasswordAuthentication` in `sshd_config` to no. Reload SSH daemon for your
changes to take effect.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

Setup basic firewall with UFW to make sure only connections to certain services
are allowed.

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

If configured correctly, you should see an output similar to the following:

```plaintext
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker">

Update the apt package index

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
```

Add Docker's official GPG key:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Setup the stable docker repository.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

Update the apt package index:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the latest version of _Docker Engine - Community_ and _containerd_:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Since we do not want to preface every `docker` command with `sudo`, create a
Unix group called `docker`.

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

Add current user to the newly created docker user group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Now log out and log back in again and check if you can successfully run docker
without using sudo.

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose">

Download Docker Compose executable from artifacts of their latest GitHub
release:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.3/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Fix permissions of the downloaded binary:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="aws-cli">

Download and install official AWS command line tools.

```bash
cd ~
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./install
aws --version
rm awscliv2.zip
```

## Pulling Docker Images

We can use AWS CLI to obtain Touca docker images from the AWS Elastic Container
Registry. The commands in this section reference the following parameters that
should be replaced with credentials that we provide to you.

- `TOUCA_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `TOUCA_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `TOUCA_AWS_REGION`
- `TOUCA_AWS_REPO`

### Authenticate to AWS Container Registry

Run the following command to create an AWS profile.

```bash
aws configure
```

This command opens an interactive prompt to let you provide credentials for
Access Key, Secret, Region, and Output Format.

```bash
<TOUCA_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
<TOUCA_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
<TOUCA_AWS_REGION>
json
```

Now that your profile is set up, run the following to authenticate to the AWS
Container Registry.

```bash
mkdir ~/touca
aws ecr get-login-password --region <TOUCA_AWS_REGION>
```

The expected output of this command is a long text. We do not need to store it
anywhere.

Now that things are set up with AWS, we can login to the container registry via
Docker.

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region <TOUCA_AWS_REGION> | docker login <TOUCA_AWS_REPO> --username AWS --password-stdin
```

Now we can pull our images from the registry.

```bash
docker pull <TOUCA_AWS_REPO>/touca-api:1.4.0
docker pull <TOUCA_AWS_REPO>/touca-app:1.4.0
docker pull <TOUCA_AWS_REPO>/touca-cmp:1.4.0
```

## Deploy Docker Containers

Extract the deployment scripts archive and install it in the appropriate path.

```bash
ssh touca@your-machine
mkdir -p touca; cd touca;
scp devops.tar.gz touca@your-machine:~/
tar -zxf ../devops.tar.gz
rm ../devops.tar.gz
```

Before running the docker containers, create the local directories \(volumes\)
to which they bind.

```bash
mkdir -p local/logs/backend local/logs/cmp
sudo chown 8002:touca local/logs/backend local/logs/cmp
mkdir -p local/data/minio local/data/mongo local/data/redis
```

Modify values of the following environment variables in
`devops/docker-compose.prod.yaml` file. Do not wrap the values in single or
double quotations.

- `AUTH_JWT_SECRET`, `AUTH_COOKIE_SECRET`

  We recommend a randomly generated string of 32 characters length.

- `MAIL_TRANSPORT_HOST`, `MAIL_TRANSPORT_USER`, `MAIL_TRANSPORT_PASS`

  Set these values based on your mail server configurations.

- `WEBAPP_ROOT`

  Root URL of the Touca server. Can be of the form
  `https://touca.your-company.com` or `http://172.142.42.42`.

Now run `devops/deploy.sh` to deploy Touca via Docker Compose.

```bash
~/touca/devops/deploy.sh -r <TOUCA_AWS_REPO> -u AWS
```

Monitor standard output of docker containers to check that everything is running
as expected:

```bash
docker-compose -f ~/touca/devops/docker-compose.prod.yml --project-directory ~/touca logs --follow
```

At this time, you should be able to verify that Touca is up and running by
navigating to your machine address on a browser.
