# Self-Hosting

Touca Server and Touca SDKs are all open-source with a permissive Apache-2
license. You can deploy Touca Server locally or to your own cloud
infrastructure. We've made the process straightforward and self-serve. If you
ever needed help or had any questions, you are welcome to
[join our Community Discord server](https://touca.io/discord), or
[send us an email](mailto:support@touca.io).

:::info

Most of our paid plans include dedicated support and professional services for
deploying and upgrading self-hosted instances of Touca.

:::

## Prerequisites

Touca server has a few components and services. In the most basic deployment
scenario, you could run them as Docker containers on a single machine.

The instructions below help you get started with this common scenario. To run
this script, you need a UNIX machine with at least 2GB of RAM, with Docker and
Docker Compose.

There is no restriction for the choice of Unix distribution. The instructions
below are written for and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS distribution.

## Prepare your machine

This section helps you install Docker and Docker Compose if you do not have them
installed locally. They are provided for completeness.

  <TabItem value="setup">

If you have just provisioned a virtual machine, here are a few general best
practices to secure it for production use.

Create a new user

```bash
sudo adduser touca
sudo usermod -aG sudo touca
```

Add public key authentication

```bash
rsync --archive --chown=touca:touca ~/.ssh /home/touca
```

Disable password authentication

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Set `PasswordAuthentication` in `sshd_config` to no. Reload SSH daemon for your
changes to take effect.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

Setup basic firewall with UFW to make sure only connections to certain services
are allowed.

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

If configured correctly, you should see an output similar to the following:

```plaintext
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker">

Update the apt package index

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
```

Add Docker's official GPG key:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Setup the stable docker repository.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

Update the apt package index:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the latest version of _Docker Engine - Community_ and _containerd_:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Since we do not want to preface every `docker` command with `sudo`, create a
Unix group called `docker`.

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

Add current user to the newly created docker user group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Now log out and log back in again and check if you can successfully run docker
without using sudo.

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose">

Download Docker Compose executable from artifacts of their latest GitHub
release:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.3/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Fix permissions of the downloaded binary:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Run Install Script

We offer a one-liner bash script to help with locally installing Touca Server.
Simply run the following command in the terminal to have the script download
public Touca docker images and run them.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://touca.io/install.sh)"
```

This script interactively asks you the server installation path, among other
things. Once it runs to complition, it will redirect you to the locally
installed server to perform basic server configurations and create your first
user account.

:::note Uninstall Instructions

We have a separate script to help you uninstall your self-hosted instance:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://touca.io/uninstall.sh)"
```

This script stops all running containers and removes all server data from the
filesystem. Run `rm -r $HOME/.touca` if you like to remove Touca CLI
configurations and any locally stored test results.
