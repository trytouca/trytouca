# Free plan

Touca has a free and open-source edition, ideal for individuals and very small
businesses. You can sign up for free (no credit card required) on our managed
cloud instance at [app.touca.io](https://app.touca.io) and go through our
self-serve onboarding to get started with Touca. You could also self-host your
own Touca server OSS edition using docker compose. We also offer a Helm Chart to
help you deploy Touca to a Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

<summary>ðŸ’¡ How is Touca Cloud different from self-hosted instances?</summary>

- Touca Cloud is fully managed. We maintain and upgrade this instance to provide
  the most convenience for customers and the best experience for users.
- Touca Cloud has a different architecture to provide highest availability, and
  maximum scalability. We use AWS services like S3, DocumentDB, and Elasticache
  to provide reliable infrastructure for handling the most demanding use-cases.
  In contrast, self-hosted instances of Touca server use off-the-shelf Minio,
  MongoDB, and Redis docker containers that are less scalable and require
  periodic maintenance to manage disk space, etc.

# Teams plan

Touca offers a team plan, priced at $25/seat/month, ideal for small startups and
engineering teams at large companies. This tier allows teams to share their test
results with each other and work together to investigate and manage differences.
Benefits include:

- Member Management: Invite your colleagues to your team to give them shared
  access to the submitted test results. Give select team members administrator
  privileges to help you manage users and test results.
- Collaboration: Let team members comment on test result versions, claim
  responsibility for regressions in a given version, and share their reasoning
  when approving new differences.
- Insights: Leverage our analytics engine to extract high-level insights about
  individual test cases.

# Enterprise plan

Touca has an Enterprise edition, starting at $1000/month, suitable for
businesses who would like to use Touca across multiple engineering team or who
may have special security or data privacy needs. Benefits include:

- Security: Use an isolated single-tenant instance of Touca, with similar
  features and scalable infrastructure as our managed cloud instance.
- Services: We offer priority support, monthly office hours, and full management
  and upkeep of your Touca instance, whether you are self-hosting it or using
  our cloud infrastructure.
