Touca is free and open-source. You can sign up on our managed cloud instance at
[app.touca.io](https://app.touca.io) and go through our self-serve onboarding to
get started with Touca. You could also self-host your own Touca server using
docker compose. We also offer a Helm Chart to help you deploy Touca to a
Kubernetes cluster on AWS.

<summary>ðŸ’¡ How is Touca Cloud different from self-hosted instances?</summary>

- Touca Cloud is fully managed. We maintain and upgrade this instance to provide
  the most convenience and offer the best experience for users.
- Touca Cloud has a different architecture to provide highest availability, and
  maximum scalability. We use AWS services like S3, DocumentDB, and Elasticache
  to provide reliable infrastructure for handling the most demanding use-cases.
  In contrast, self-hosted instances of Touca server use off-the-shelf Minio,
  MongoDB, and Redis docker containers that are less scalable and require
  periodic maintenance to manage disk space, etc.
