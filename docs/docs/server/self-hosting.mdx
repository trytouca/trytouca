# Self-Hosting

Touca Server and Touca SDKs are open-source with a permissive Apache-2 license.
You can deploy Touca Server locally or to your own cloud infrastructure. We've
made the process straightforward and self-serve.
[Join us on Discord](https://touca.io/discord) or
[send us an email](mailto:support@touca.io) if you need help or had any
questions.

:::info

Most of our paid plans include dedicated support and professional services for
deploying and upgrading self-hosted instances of Touca.

:::

We support two different self-hosted deployments of Touca:

1. You can host Touca as a set of Docker containers on a single machine. This
   setup uses Docker Compose and is most suitable for individuals and small
   engineering teams.
2. You can deploy Touca to your Kubernetes cluster using our Helm chart. This
   setup is suitable for engineering teams who are used to hosting third-party
   tools on Kubernetes.

Both deployments use MinIO, MongoDB, and Redis as service dependencies. If you
plan on using Touca at scale, we encourage you to upgrade to our paid deployment
setups that use DocumentDB, ElastiCache and S3 instead.

## Using Docker Compose

This section helps you install Docker and Docker Compose if you do not have them
installed locally. They are provided for completeness.

  <TabItem value="setup">

If you have just provisioned a virtual machine, here are a few general best
practices to secure it for production use.

Create a new user

```bash
sudo adduser touca
sudo usermod -aG sudo touca
```

Add public key authentication

```bash
rsync --archive --chown=touca:touca ~/.ssh /home/touca
```

Disable password authentication

```bash
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Set `PasswordAuthentication` in `sshd_config` to no. Reload SSH daemon for your
changes to take effect.

```bash
sudo systemctl reload sshd
```

Setup basic firewall with UFW to make sure only connections to certain services
are allowed.

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

If configured correctly, you should see an output similar to the following:

```plaintext
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker">

Update the apt package index

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

```bash
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
```

Add Docker's official GPG key:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

Setup the stable docker repository.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

Update the apt package index:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install the latest version of _Docker Engine - Community_ and _containerd_:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Since we do not want to preface every `docker` command with `sudo`, create a
Unix group called `docker`.

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

Add current user to the newly created docker user group.

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Now log out and log back in again and check if you can successfully run docker
without using sudo.

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docker-compose">

Download Docker Compose executable from artifacts of their latest GitHub
release:

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.3/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Fix permissions of the downloaded binary:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### Installing

You can install Touca server locally using either the Touca CLI or our
`install.sh` script.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="python"
  groupId="self-hosted-install"
  values={[
    { label: "Using Touca CLI", value: "python" },
    { label: "Using Bash", value: "bash" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="bash">

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://touca.io/install.sh)"
```

This command uses `docker-compose` to install the server into `~/.touca/server`
and run it. Once the install is over, navigate to Touca server and complete the
install wizard.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">

The best way to manage Touca server is through our CLI.

```bash
pip install touca
```

The [`touca server`](../../cli/#server-management) subcommand helps you install,
upgrade, and uninstall the Touca server, as well as to check its status and
logs.

```bash
touca server install
```

This command uses `docker-compose` to install the server into `~/.touca/server`
and run it. Once the install is over, navigate to Touca server and complete the
install wizard.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Uninstalling

If you ever need to uninstall the server, you can use the following command to
stop the running containers and remove all server data from the filesystem.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="python"
  groupId="self-hosted-install"
  values={[
    { label: "Using Touca CLI", value: "python" },
    { label: "Using Bash", value: "bash" },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="bash">

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://touca.io/install.sh)" -- --uninstall
```

Note the extra `--` before `--uninstall`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python">

```bash
touca server uninstall
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you have any locally stored test results, you can manually remove them by
running `rm -r $HOME/.touca/results`.
