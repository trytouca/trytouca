# Terms of Service

Touca, Inc. \("we", "our", "us"\) offers a variety of developer productivity tools available online \(collectively, the "Service"\), via websites, including but not limited to [touca.io](https://touca.io) and its subdomains \(the "Websites"\).

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.

We may revise the Terms from time to time. If a revision is material, as determined solely by us, we will notify you \(for example via email to the email address associated with your account\). The most current version will always be posted on our Terms page. By continuing to use Touca after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new Terms, please stop using Touca.

### Content

Our Service allows you to post, link, store, share and otherwise make available certain information, text, graphics, videos, or other material \("Content"\). You are responsible for the Content that you post on or through the Service, including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.

By posting Content on or through the Service, You represent and warrant that: \(i\) the Content is yours \(you own it\) and/or you have the right to use it and the right to grant us the rights and license as provided in these Terms, and \(ii\) that the posting of your Content on or through the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a copyright.

You retain any and all of your rights to any Content you submit, post or display on or through the Service and you are responsible for protecting those rights. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for Content you or any third party posts on or through the Service. Touca has the right but not the obligation to monitor all Content provided by users.

In addition, Content found on or through this Service that are not originally submitted, posted, or displayed by users are the property of Touca or used with permission. You may not distribute, modify, transmit, reuse, download, repost, copy, or use said Content, whether in whole or in part, for commercial purposes or for personal gain, without express advance written permission from us.

You can remove your content by deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of your content \(such as Content you submit to teams you do not own\) may not be completely removed and copies of your content may continue to exist on Touca. Weâ€™re not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of \(or the failure to remove or delete\) any of your content.
