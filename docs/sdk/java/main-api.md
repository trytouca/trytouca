# Main API of Java SDK

[So far](./quickstart.md), we learned how to write and run a simple Touca test
using the Touca SDK for Java. But our previous `isPrime` example was too minimal
to show how Touca can help us describe the behavior and performance of
real-world software workflows. Let us use a Profile Lookup software as another
example that takes the username of a student and returns basic information about
them, such as their name, date of birth, and GPA.
