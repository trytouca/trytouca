# Keyboard Shortcuts

## Navigation

Touca has always had basic support for navigating the test results using keyboard.

*   Use `j` and `k` to scroll through the items in each page.
*   Use `Enter` to explore the content of each item in a list.
*   Use `Backspace` to go back to higher levels of the test results hierarchy.

## Interaction

When exploring the test results submitted for a given test case, you can use keyboard shortcut `v` to toggle \(reveal/hide\) the actual and expected values of the test results with complex data types.
