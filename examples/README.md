# Sample Touca Tests

This repository includes example projects in different programming languages
to help you get started with Touca. All examples are documented to serve as
hands-on tutorials that show you how to write tests with different Touca SDKs.

We encourage you to clone this repository and to run these examples as you
go through them.
If this is your first time submitting test results to Touca, we highly
encourage you to read this short [Getting Started](./Getting_Started.md)
guide, first.
