This repository provides a collection of sample regression test tools
that showcase how to use Weasel Client Libraries.

## What is Weasel?

[Weasel][Platform] is a continuous regression testing solution that helps
engineering teams understand the impact of their daily code changes.

[Weasel][Platform] enables engineers to establish a baseline for any software
execution workflow that describes the approved behavior and performance of
that workflow.
When engineers make subsequent changes to the components involved in that
workflow, Weasel identifies and reports any potential change of behavior
or performance and helps engineers determine if such change matches their
expectations. Weasel allows engineers to keep track of the requirements
of each software component and helps them perform major refactors without
violating those requirements.
