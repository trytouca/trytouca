# Examples using Touca Python SDK

This directory includes sample test tools that use Touca Python SDK.

If you are new to Touca, we recommend starting with our
[documentation website](https://touca.io/docs).

## Outline

1.  [Python SDK Introduction](./01_python_minimal)

    This example walks you through writing your first Touca test using our
    Python SDK to show you what Touca is, how it works, and how a typical Touca
    test looks like.

2.  [Python SDK Main API](./02_python_main_api)

    This example walks you through using Touca Python SDK to capture the
    behavior and performance of your code for different test cases. This example
    is documented [here](https://touca.io/docs/sdk/main-api).

3.  [Python SDK Core API](./03_python_core_api)

    This example demonstrates using the lower-level API of Touca Python SDK for
    scenarios in which you may not want to use the built-in test runner such as
    when integrating Touca with other test frameworks. This example is
    documented [here](https://touca.io/docs/sdk/core-api).

4.  [Using Touca for testing image processing workflows](./04_python_image_processing)
5.  [Using Touca for testing machine learning pipelines](./05_python_ml_pipeline)
6.  [Using Touca for testing computer vision systems](./06_python_computer_vision)
