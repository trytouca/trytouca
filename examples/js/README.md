# Examples using Touca Node.js SDK

This directory includes sample test tools that use Touca Node.js SDK.

If you are new to Touca, we recommend starting with our
[documentation website](https://touca.io/docs).

## Outline

1.  [Node.js SDK Introduction](./01_node_minimal)

    This example walks you through writing your first Touca test using our
    Node.js SDK to show you what Touca is, how it works, and how a typical Touca
    test looks like. This example corresponds to the tutorial
    [here](https://touca.io/docs/basics/submit).

2.  [Node.js SDK Main API](./02_node_main_api)

    This example walks you through using Touca Node.js SDK to capture the
    behavior and performance of your code for different test cases. This example
    corresponds to the tutorial [here](https://touca.io/docs/sdk/main-api).

3.  [Node.js SDK Core API](./03_node_core_api)

    This example demonstrates using the lower-level API of Touca Node.js SDK for
    scenarios in which you may not want to use the built-in test runner such as
    when integrating Touca with other test frameworks. This example corresponds
    to the tutorial [here](https://touca.io/docs/sdk/core-api).
