# Examples using Touca SDK for Node.js

This directory includes sample projects that use Touca SDK for Node.js. All
examples are documented to serve as hands-on tutorials to help you get stated
with Touca.

If this is your first time submitting test results to Touca, we recommend
reading our [Getting Started](https://touca.io/docs) guide, first.

## Outline

1.  [Introducing Touca](./01_node_minimal)

    This example walks you through writing your first Touca test for an
    `is_prime` function, using our Node.js SDK.

    In 3 minutes, you will learn what Touca is, how it works, and how a typical
    Touca test looks like.

2.  [Touca Node.js SDK](./02_node_main_api)

    This example shows you how to use Touca Node.js SDK to write and run test
    tools that describe the behavior and performance of your code for different
    test cases.

    In 3 minutes, you will learn how to use Touca SDK to test your own
    workflows.

3.  [Touca Node.js API](./03_node_core_api)

    This example walks you through the lower-level Node.js client API. It is
    most helpful to engineers who want to use Touca data capturing functions in
    their production code.

    In 5 minutes, you will learn how to disable Touca functions in production
    environments, how the SDK retrieves test cases from the Touca server, and
    how it submits captured data to the server.
