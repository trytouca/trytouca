# Examples using Touca C++ SDK

This directory includes sample test tools that use Touca C++ SDK. All examples
are documented to serve as hands-on tutorials to help you get stated with Touca.

If you are new to Touca, we recommend starting with our
[documentation website](https://touca.io/docs).

## Outline

1.  [C++ SDK Introduction](./01_cpp_minimal)

    This example walks you through writing your first Touca test using our C++
    SDK to show you what Touca is, how it works, and how a typical Touca test
    looks like.

2.  [C++ SDK Main API](./02_cpp_main_api)

    This example walks you through using Touca C++ SDK to capture the behavior
    and performance of your code for different test cases.

3.  [C++ SDK Core API](./03_cpp_core_api)

    This example demonstrates using the lower-level API of Touca C++ SDK for
    scenarios in which you may not want to use the built-in test runner such as
    when integrating Touca with other test frameworks.

4.  [Using External Inputs](./04_cpp_external_input)

    This example demonstrates using JSON files in a directory as test inputs to
    a Touca test workflow.
