# Examples using Touca C++ SDK

This directory includes sample test tools that use Touca C++ SDK.

If you are new to Touca, we recommend starting with our
[documentation website](https://touca.io/docs).

## Outline

1.  [C++ SDK Minimal Example](./01_cpp_minimal)
2.  [C++ SDK Main API](./02_cpp_main_api)

    This example walks you through using Touca C++ SDK to capture the behavior
    and performance of your code for different test cases. This example
    corresponds to the tutorial [here](https://touca.io/docs/sdk/main-api).

3.  [C++ SDK Core API](./03_cpp_core_api)

    This example demonstrates using the lower-level API of Touca C++ SDK for
    scenarios in which you may not want to use the built-in test runner such as
    when integrating Touca with other test frameworks. This example corresponds
    to the tutorial [here](https://touca.io/docs/sdk/core-api).

4.  [Using External Inputs](./04_cpp_external_input)

    This example demonstrates using JSON files in a directory as test inputs to
    a Touca test workflow.
