# Examples using Touca SDK for C++

This directory includes sample projects that use Touca SDK for C++.
All examples are documented to serve as hands-on tutorials to help you
get stated with Touca.

If this is your first time submitting test results to Touca, we recommend
reading our [Getting Started](https://docs.touca.io) guide, first.

## Outline

1.  [Introducing Touca](./01\_cpp_minimal)

    This example walks you through writing your first Touca test for an
    `is_prime` function, using our C++ SDK.

    In 3 minutes, you will learn what Touca is, how it works, and how a
    typical Touca test looks like.

2.  [Touca C++ SDK Main API](./02\_cpp_main_api)

    This example shows you how to use Touca C++ SDK to write and run
    test tools that describe the behavior and performance of your code
    for different test cases.

    In 3 minutes, you will learn how to use Touca SDK to test your own
    workflows.

3.  [Touca C++ SDK Core API](./03\_cpp_core_api)

    This example walks you through the lower-level C++ client API.
    It is most helpful to engineers who want to use Touca data capturing
    functions in their production code.

    In 5 minutes, you will learn how to disable Touca functions in
    production environments, how the SDK retrieves test cases from the
    Touca server, and how it submits captured data to the server.
